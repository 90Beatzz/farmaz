A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/andersschmidt/pen/VYqqNe.

 Here, I re-create (http://codyhouse.co/demo/product-preview-slider/index.html#0) in order to see if the Expressive BEM approach is useful at all.

The vocabulary mixins are found here: http://codepen.io/andersschmidt/pen/MYZqar?editors=010, but are subject to change. :)
